\opening{Dear Sir or Madam,}  
		
Please consider the attached submission for publication in \journal. 
This work is a unique investigation of the pyric-herbivory/fire-grazing interaction in an invertebrate community, and as such is a novel contribution to the understanding of wildland fire interactions with biodiversity. 

We look forward to working with the editors and reviewers of \journal~to ensure our manuscript meets the standards of the journal.
