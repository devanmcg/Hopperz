Their control is critical to food security worldwide and often requires governmental or international involvement. Although locust and grasshopper outbreaks are now better controlled and often shorter in duration and reduced in extent, large outbreaks, often promoted by climate change, continue to occur in many parts of the world. While some locust and grasshopper control systems are still curative, the recognition of the damage these pests can cause and the socioeconomic consequences of locust and grasshopper outbreaks have led to an increasing paradigm shift from crop protection to preventive management. Effective preventive management strategy relies on an improved knowledge of the pest biology and ecology and more efficient monitoring and control techniques.},

The models are based on a four-phase sequence of impacts attributable to prescribed burning (fuel development, combustion, shock and ecosystem recovery) which partition acute and chronic fire influences on arthropod populations. Applications for manipulating arthropod populations may be refined by quantifying arthropod responses during each phase of prescribed burning.},

This study was designed to examine the effect of a grassland wildfire on grasshopper community composition and population densities of three grasshopper subfamilies in western North Dakota northern mixed-grass prairie with sampling in paired burned and unburned plots. A rapidly moving fire occurred in late October 1999, after egg-overwintering grasshoppers had died. Vegetation biomass and nitrogen content of grasses did not differ statistically between burned and unburned plots in 2000. The fire negatively affected grasshopper population densities the year after the fire, but species diversity was not affected by the fire. Much of the reduction in grasshopper population densities was caused by a decline in densities of Gomphocerinae species. Grasshopper subfamily densities did not differ statistically between burned and unburned plots in 2001. Additional research is needed to determine the mechanisms leading to the reduction in Gomphocerinae species densities.},

  abstract = {Rangeland ﬁre is a common naturally occurring event and management tool, with the amount and structure of biomass controlling transfer of heat belowground. Temperatures that grasshopper eggs are exposed to during rangeland ﬁres are mediated by species-speciﬁc oviposition traits. This experiment examined egg mortality in two slant-faced grasshopper species with differing oviposition traits, namely Aulocara elliotti (Thomas) and Opeia obscura (Thomas). We hypothesized that A. elliotti egg mortality would increase with ﬁre intensity because the shallow egg location below the soil surface would result in exposure to higher temperatures, and that the deeper O. obscura eggs would not be affected by ﬁre intensity. Fire intensity did not signiﬁcantly affect the mortality of O. obscura eggs, with very low mortality in all treatments. Fire intensity signiﬁcantly affected mortality of A. elliotti eggs, which are laid in shallow egg pods with the midpoint of the egg clutch at a depth of {\textasciitilde} 0.825 cm. Aulocara elliotti egg mortality increased with higher levels of heat application, with 79\% egg mortality in the 4 500 kg Á haÀ1 heat treatment. Heat effects on A. elliotti egg mortality were similar to those previously observed for another shallow-egg-laying species. Limited research has examined if rangeland ﬁres reduce population densities of speciﬁc economically important grasshopper species. The results from this experiment indicate that grasshopper species with the midpoint of the egg pod less than 1 cm below the surface are likely in general to be vulnerable to ﬁre-induced egg mortality during rangeland ﬁres.},

  abstract = {Sustaining livestock agriculture is important for global food security. Livestock productivity, however, can fluctuate due to many environmental factors, including climate variability. Current predictions of continued warming, decreased precipitation, and increased climate variability worldwide raise serious questions for scientists and producers alike. Foremost is understanding how to mitigate livestock production losses attributed to climate extremes and variability. We investigated the influence of spatial heterogeneity on livestock production over six years in tallgrass prairie of the southern Great Plains, USA. We manipulated heterogeneity by allowing fire and grazing to interact spatially and temporally at broad scales across pastures ranging from 430 to 900ha. We found that the influence of precipitation on livestock productivity was contingent upon heterogeneity. When heterogeneity was absent, livestock productivity decreased with reduced rainfall. In contrast, when heterogeneity was present, there was no relationship with rainfall and livestock productivity, resulting in heterogeneity stabilizing livestock productivity through time. With predicted increases in climate variability and uncertainty, managing for heterogeneity may assist livestock producers in adapting to climate change and in mitigating livestock productivity loss caused by climatic variability.},

  abstract = {The interactions between fire and grazing are widespread throughout fire-dependent landscapes. The utilization of burned areas by grazing animals establishes the fire–grazing interaction, but the preference for recently burned areas relative to other influences (water, topography, etc.) is unknown. In this study, we determine the strength of the fire–grazing interaction by quantifying the influence of fire on ungulate site selection. We compare the preference for recently burned patches relative to the influence of other environmental factors that contribute to site selection; compare that preference between native and introduced ungulates; test relationships between area burned and herbivore preference; and determine forage quality and quantity as mechanisms of site selection. We used two large ungulate species at two grassland locations within the southern Great Plains, USA. At each location, spatially distinct patches were burned within larger areas through time, allowing animals to select among burned and unburned areas. Using fine scale ungulate location data, we estimated resource selection functions to examine environmental factors in site selection. Ungulates preferred recently burned areas and avoided areas with greater time since fire, regardless of the size of landscape, herbivore species, or proportion of area burned. Forage quality was inversely related to time since fire, while forage quantity was positively related. We show that fire is an important component of large ungulate behavior with a strong influence on site selection that drives the fire–grazing interaction. This interaction is an ecosystem process that supersedes fire and grazing as separate factors, shaping grassland landscapes. Inclusion of the fire–grazing interaction into ecological studies and conservation practices of fire-prone systems will aid in better understanding and managing these systems.},

  abstract = {The primary reason animals, including insect herbivores, eat is to acquire a mix of nutrients needed to fuel the processes of growth, development, and reproduction. Most insect herbivores strongly regulate their nutrient intake when given the opportunity. When they are restricted to imbalanced diets, they employ regulatory rules that govern the extent to which nutrients occurring in excess or deficit are eaten. Insect herbivores also regularly encounter allelochemicals as they eat, and recent work indicates the effect an allelochemical has on nutrient regulation, and insect herbivore performance, is modified depending on a food's nutrient composition. Comparative studies of nutrient regulation suggest coexisting generalist herbivores occupy unique nutritional feeding niches, and work with pathogens and parasitoids has revealed the manner in which top-down pressures influence patterns of nutrient intake. Insect herbivores regulate their nutrient intake using pre- and postingestive mechanisms, plus learning, and there is evidence that some of these mechanisms are shaped by natural selection.},

  abstract = {The Northern Great Plains (NGP) region of the USA—which comprises Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska—is a largely rural area that provides numerous ecosystem services, including livestock products, cultural services, and conservation of biological diversity. The region contains 25\% of the Nation’s beef cattle and approximately one-third of the confined beef cattle, as well as the largest remaining native prairie in the US—the Northern Mixedgrass Prairie. With rising atmospheric CO2, the NGP is projected to experience warmer and longer growing seasons, greater climatic variability, and more extreme events (e.g., increased occurrence of large precipitation events). These climatic changes may affect livestock production both directly via physiological impacts on animals and indirectly via modifications to forage, invasion of undesirable plants, and increased exposure to parasites. This raises concerns about the vulnerability of grazing livestock operations and confined livestock operations to projected changes in mid- (2050) and late- (2085) twenty-first century climate. Our objectives are to (1) describe the NGP’s exposure to temperature and precipitation trends, inter-annual variability, and extreme events; (2) evaluate the sensitivity of beef cattle production to direct and indirect effects imposed by these projected climatic changes; and (3) provide a typology of adaptation strategies to minimize adverse consequences of projected changes and maximize beneficial consequences. Agricultural managers have developed considerable adaptive capacity to contend with environmental and economic variability. However, projected climatic changes, especially the increased frequency and magnitude of weather extremes, will require even greater adaptive capacity to maintain viable production systems. Consequently, regional vulnerability to projected climatic changes will be determined not only by ecological responses but also by the adaptive capacity of individual managers. Adaptive capacity in the NGP will differ from other regions, in part because projections suggest some opportunities for increased livestock production. Adaptations in both grazing and confined beef cattle systems will require enhanced decision-making skills capable of integrating biophysical, social, and economic considerations. Social learning networks that support integration of experimental and experiential knowledge—such as lessons learned from early adopters and involvement with science-based organizations—can help enhance decision-making and climate adaptation planning. Many adaptations have already been implemented by a subset of producers in this region, providing opportunities for assessment, further development, and greater adoption. Context-specific decision-making can also be enhanced through science-management partnerships, which aim to build adaptive capacity that recognizes multiple production and conservation/environmental goals.},

We present a novel model of grass, which fully integrates shoot morphogenesis and the metabolism of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) at organ scale, within a three-dimensional representation of plant architecture. Plant morphogenesis is seen as a self-regulated system driven by two main mechanisms. First, the rate of organ extension and the establishment of architectural traits are regulated by concentrations of C and N metabolites in the growth zones and the temperature. Second, the timing of extension is regulated by rules coordinating successive phytomers instead of a thermal time schedule. Local concentrations are calculated from a model of C and N metabolism at organ scale. The three-dimensional representation allows the accurate calculation of light and temperature distribution within the architecture. The model was calibrated for wheat (Triticum aestivum) and evaluated for early vegetative stages. This approach allowed the simulation of realistic patterns of leaf dimensions, extension dynamics, and organ mass and composition. The model simulated, as emergent properties, plant and agronomic traits. Metabolic activities of growing leaves were investigated in relation to whole-plant functioning and environmental conditions. The current model is an important step towards a better understanding of the plasticity of plant phenotype in different environments.},

In this study, significant differences in grasshopper density were detected among adjacent watersheds from Kansas Flint Hills tallgrass prairie that differed in fire frequency and especially bison grazing treatments. Grasshopper densities were \&amp;ap;2.5 times greater in grazed watersheds compared with ungrazed ones. Grasshopper densities also varied somewhat in response to fire frequency, mostly in species-specific ways. No treatment interactions on overall grasshopper density were detected. The effects of fire frequency and bison grazing were implemented in part through their combined effect on the structural heterogeneity of vegetation, and other habitat characteristics. Individual grasshopper species responded uniquely to combinations of fire frequency and bison grazing. Grazing resulted in significant increases in density for seven of the nine most abundant species; fire frequency affected two species; and one species did not respond to either fire or grazing. Understanding effects of habitat on grasshopper densities provides opportunities to manage these populations for economic or conservation needs.},

  abstract   = {Global biodiversity hotspots are rich in endemic insect species, many of which are threatened by the ongoing anthropogenic pressures on their habitats. The Cape region (South Africa) is one of these biodiversity hotspots, maintaining a high number of endemics. However, the ecology of most insect species in this region remains poorly understood. The two Orthoptera species Betiscoides meridionalis and Betiscoides parva are endemic to the Cape region and specialized on restio vegetation. They are threatened by increasing wildfire frequencies and invasions of non-native plant species. However, this information has been inferred from habitat changes, whereas no ecological study on these species has been conducted since they have been described. In order to facilitate conservation management, information on the ecology of these species is urgently required. The aim of our study was (1) to obtain data on the population ecology (particularly population sizes and mobility), and (2) to study the behavior of both species in response to environmental factors. For this purpose a mark-recapture-study and an observational behavior study were conducted. Both species had small population sizes and a low mobility with males moving greater distances than females. Wind had a strong influence on the behavior of Betiscoides, particularly on the small males of B. parva. Future studies might thus focus on the question whether wind-exposure is a critical factor for habitat choice of this species.

  abstract = {Ecological theory predicts that diversity decreases variability in ecosystem function. We predict that, at the landscape scale, spatial variability created by a mosaic of contrasting patches that differ in time since disturbance will decrease temporal variability in aboveground plant biomass. Using data from a multi-year study of seven grazed tallgrass prairie landscapes, each experimentally managed for one to eight patches, we show that increased spatial variability driven by spatially patchy fire and herbivory reduces temporal variability in aboveground plant biomass. This pattern is associated with statistical evidence for the portfolio effect and a positive relationship between temporal variability and functional group synchrony as predicted by metacommunity variability theory. As disturbance from fire and grazing interact to create a shifting mosaic of spatially heterogeneous patches within a landscape, temporal variability in aboveground plant biomass can be dampened. These results suggest that spatially heterogeneous disturbance regimes contribute to a portfolio of ecosystem functions provided by biodiversity, including wildlife habitat, fuel, and forage. We discuss how spatial patterns of disturbance drive variability within and among patches.},

  abstract = {Secondary production of the acridid community on Konza Prairie Biological Station, Kansas, was estimated to evaluate its significance to energy and nutrient cycling in annually burned and long-term unburned tallgrass prairie. A drop-trap and vacuum device were used to sample acridids on three watersheds in both the burned and unburned prairies during the 1998 and 1999 growing seasons. Production of common species was estimated using the instantaneous growth method, and consumption and egestion were estimated using ecological efficiencies. Total acridid abundance, biomass, and production estimates showed a trend of higher values on burned than on unburned watersheds during both years with significantly higher biomass and production on burned watersheds during 1998 ( P \&lt; 0.05). Higher biomass and production on burned watersheds was primarily a result of higher values for graminivorous taxa. Forb-feeder and grass-feeder production was more similar on unburned than on burned watersheds, although responses of individual species varied greatly between the two watershed types and years. Grass-feeders and forb-feeders consumed an estimated 0.4-4.7 g ash-free dry mass (AFDM) m -2 yr -1 of grass and 0.7-2.1 g AFDM m -2 yr -1 of forbs, respectively, depending on watershed type and year. Results indicate that acridids are important in nitrogen cycling. However, their relative importance to energy and nutrient cycling in tallgrass prairie varies with plant responses to burning and may be influenced by ungulate grazing.},

  abstract = {The northern Great Plains have long been dominated by conventional tillage systems and cereal-based rotations including summer fallow. Over the last decade, however, the use of conservation tillage systems has markedly increased and, through improved moisture storage, has provided an opportunity for more diversified extended rotations including oilseed, pulse, and forage crops throughout the region. Considerable research is being carried out to assess the adaptability of these new crops and to develop appropriate management strategies. Typically, this type of agronomic research is carried out at plot-sized research sites, with the findings then being extrapolated to surrounding regions where growing conditions are thought to be reasonably similar. Because the environment itself largely dictates the success of a particular cropping system, extrapolation requires knowledge of the environmental conditions of the region and, in particular, the interaction of environmental components of soil and climate in relation to specific crop requirements. This paper describes 14 agroecoregions in the northern Great Plains and provides an initial framework for extrapolating agronomic information at broad regional scales. Because climate is the dominant crop production factor in the region, most of the agroecosystems represent broad climatic zones. Each agroecoregion is described in terms of its soil and landscape characteristics, with a particular focus being given to likely key environmental parameters related to the production of the new oilseed, pulse, and forage crops being introduced in the region.},

We recorded the relative use of burns occurring at different stages in the seasonal cycle, as well as in different regions of the landscape by two herds of sable. We also recorded behavioural measures of foraging efficiency and faecal nutrient contents as an indication of nutrient gains. Sable consistently concentrated their grazing on burned areas provided there was sufficient green regrowth during the dry season. In these circumstances they grazed for longer per feeding station, showed a slower step rate while foraging, and shorter between-patch moves, and a higher probability of encountering acceptable food per step taken while foraging than on unburnt areas. In the year when only a burn with insufficient regrowth was available, sable continued to forage in the area that had been burned during the previous year. Faecal crude protein was substantially higher at the end of the dry season in the year when burned areas were utilized. Accordingly early dry season fires can be important in helping sable bridge the nutritional limitations posed by the dry season, provided sufficient soil moisture remains to promote adequate grass regrowth.},

  abstract = {Ecological effects of climate change are difficult to predict because climate change is a multi-variable phenomenon that can impact ecosystems through diverse pathways. Despite this fact, climate change ecology research has been dominated by relatively simplistic experiments and models. To test the importance of assessing more realistic climate and ecological scenarios an experiment was conducted to assess the interactive effects of multiple climate change variables (warming, drought) on survival and reproductive fitness across three trophic levels within a well-studied terrestrial food web. The effects of warming and drought on the nutrient content of plants and how such changes may affect consumers was also examined. Results showed that warming and drought in combination can significantly alter the nutrient profiles of plants relative to climate variables in isolation and that multi-variable climate change can severely impact plant reproductive fitness. Also, consumer nutrient profiles did not shift in accordance with their resources, but reproductive fitness of grasshoppers was nonetheless severely affected by warming and drought in combination. Predator survival rates decreased by more than 45\% under all climate change scenarios, highlighting the variable responses of different trophic levels. The impacts across the entire food web were likely caused by a combination of metabolic changes due to warming, dehydration, altered nutrient availability and resource quality, and behavioral shifts. The results suggest that realistic climate change scenarios could dramatically affect long-term demographic patterns as well as food web dynamics, and that single variable studies may fail to reveal the true impacts of climate change.},

  abstract = {Summer droughts in North America's northern Great Plains are expected to increase in frequency and duration as precipitation shifts toward spring and fall. Two rangeland experimental stations in North Dakota experienced drought in 2017 relative to 25-year averages. The southwest location had a 170-mm deficit from the 360-mm normal rainfall and was grazed by cattle (Bos taurus L.) and sheep (Ovis aries L.); the south-central location had 109 mm below the 403-mm normal rainfall and was grazed by cattle. We evaluated patch-burn grazing as a drought resilient land management strategy in the northern Great Plains by comparing average daily gains, fecal density, available forage biomass, and forage crude protein content. At the southwest location, livestock performed better during the drought season compared with animals on the same pastures in the previous year, which had near-normal rainfall but no fire. At the central location, cows on patch-burned pastures performed better than cows on continuously-grazed, unburned pastures in the same year under drought conditions; all cows were nursing calves and calf gains did not vary between treatments. In both locations, the burned patches had higher fecal density and lower available forage biomass than patches not yet burned throughout the grazing season, indicating grazer attraction to burned areas. Despite drought, burned patches maintained grazer attraction and animal performance was maintained or even improved, which contrasts with the expected relationship between animal performance and precipitation. This study indicated that prescribed patch-burning might mitigate drought by buffering forage resources (crude protein content and availability) and maintaining animal performance (average daily gains).},

  abstract = {Global climate change is predicted to increase the frequency of droughts, with major impacts on tropical savannas. It has been suggested that during drought, increased soil moisture and nutrients on termite mounds could benefit plants but it is unclear how such benefits could cascade to affect insect communities. Here, we describe the effects of drought on vegetation structure, the cascading implications for invertebrates and how termite mounds influence such effects. We compared how changes in grass biomass affected grasshopper and ant diversity on and off Macrotermes mounds before (2012) and during a drought (2016) at two locations that experienced large variation in drought severity (Skukuza and Pretoriuskop) in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. The 2013–2016 drought was not ubiquitous across the study site, with rainfall decreasing at Skukuza and being above average at Pretoriuskop. However, grass biomass declined at both locations. Grasshopper abundance decreased at droughted Skukuza both on and off mounds but decreased on mounds and increased off mounds at non-droughted Pretoriuskop. Ant abundance and species richness increased at Skukuza but remained the same on mounds and decreased off mounds at Pretoriuskop. Our results demonstrate the spatially extensive effects of drought. Despite above average rainfall in 2016 at Pretoriuskop, grass biomass decreased, likely due to an influx of large mammalian herbivores from drought-affected areas. This decrease in grass biomass cascaded to affect grasshoppers and ants, further illustrating the effects of drought on invertebrates in adjoining areas with higher rainfall. Our grasshopper results also suggest that increased drought in savannas will contribute to overall declines in insect abundance. Moreover, our recorded increase in ant abundance was primarily in the form of increases in dominant species, illustrating how drought-induced shifts in relative abundance will likely influence ecosystem structure and function. Our study highlights the phenomenon of spill-over drought effects and suggests rather than mitigating drought, termite mounds can instead become the focus for more intense grazing, with important consequences for insect communities.},

  abstract   = {Abstract: Our understanding of fire and grazing is largely based on small-scale experimental studies in which treatments are uniformly applied to experimental units that are considered homogenous. Any discussion of an interaction between fire and grazing is usually based on a statistical approach that ignores the spatial and temporal interactions on complex landscapes. We propose a new focus on the ecological interaction of fire and grazing in which each disturbance is spatially and temporally dependent on the other and results in a landscape where disturbance is best described as a shifting mosaic (a landscape with patches that vary with time since disturbance) that is critical to ecological structure and function of many ecosystems. We call this spatiotemporal interaction pyric herbivory (literal interpretation means grazing driven by fire). Pyric herbivory is the spatial and temporal interaction of fire and grazing, where positive and negative feedbacks promote a shifting pattern of disturbance across the landscape. We present data we collected from the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in the southern Great Plains of North America that demonstrates that the interaction between free-roaming bison (Bison bison) and random fires promotes heterogeneity and provides the foundation for biological diversity and ecosystem function of North American and African grasslands. This study is different from other studies of fire and grazing because the fires we examined were random and grazing animals were free to roam and select from burned and unburned patches. For ecosystems across the globe with a long history of fire and grazing, pyric herbivory with any grazing herbivore is likely more effective at restoring evolutionary disturbance patterns than a focus on restoring any large vertebrate while ignoring the interaction with fire and other disturbances.},

  abstract = {Wildﬁre activity has surged in North America’s temperate grassland biome. Like many biomes, this system has undergone drastic land-use change over the last century; however, how various land-use types contribute to wildﬁre patterns in grassland systems is unclear. We determine if certain land-use types have a greater propensity for large wildﬁre in the U.S. Great Plains and how this changes given the percentage of land covered by a given land-use type. Almost 90\% of the area burned in the Great Plains occurred in woody and grassland land-use types. Although grassland comprised the greatest area burned by large wildﬁres, woody vegetation burned disproportionately more than any other land-use type in the Great Plains. Wildﬁres were more likely to occur when woody vegetation composed greater than 20\% of the landscape. Wildﬁres were unlikely to occur in croplands, pasture/hay ﬁelds, and developed areas. Although these patterns varied by region, wildﬁre was most likely to occur in woody vegetation and/or grassland in 13 of 14 ecoregions we assessed. Because woody vegetation is more conducive to extreme wildﬁre behaviour than other land-use types in the Great Plains, woody encroachment could pose a large risk for increasing wildﬁre exposure. Regional planning could leverage diﬀerential wildﬁre activity across land-uses to devise targeted approaches that decrease human exposure in a system prone to ﬁre.},

  abstract = {Climate change forecasts of more frequent climate extremes suggest that such events will become increasingly important drivers of future ecosystem dynamics and function. Because the rarity and unpredictability of naturally occurring climate extremes limits assessment of their ecological impacts, we experimentally imposed extreme drought and a midsummer heat wave over two years in a central U.S. grassland. While the ecosystem was resistant to heat waves, it was not resistant to extreme drought, which reduced aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) below the lowest level measured in this grassland in almost 30 years. This extreme reduction in ecosystem function was a consequence of reduced productivity of both C4 grasses and C3 forbs. However, the dominant forb was negatively impacted by the drought more than the dominant grass, and this led to a reordering of species abundances within the plant community. Although this change in community composition persisted post-drought, ANPP recovered completely the year after drought due to rapid demographic responses by the dominant grass, compensating for loss of the dominant forb. Overall, these results show that an extreme reduction in ecosystem function attributable to climate extremes (e.g., low resistance) does not preclude rapid ecosystem recovery. Given that dominance by a few species is characteristic of most ecosystems, knowledge of the traits of these species and their responses to climate extremes will be key for predicting future ecosystem dynamics and function.},

  abstract = {Grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) are considered among the most damaging rangeland pests, but are necessary for the survival of many wildlife species. Most grasshoppers species are innocuous, but control with insecticides is non-discriminatory among species. The objectives were to evaluate the effects of prescribed burning on the abundance and biomass of grasshoppers and to determine if species could be selectively controlled with prescribed fire. Twenty-four, 4-ha sites were selected in a sand sagebrush-mixed prairie near Woodward, Okla. and blocked by pasture. Plots were randomly assigned fall-, spring-, or nonburned treatments within block with 4 replications per treatment for each of 2 years. Grasshopper biomass and abundance were sampled in late July and early August by sweeping with canvas beating nets. Specimens were weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg and identified to species. Fire treatments had no effects on the total abundance or biomass of grasshoppers across species, with about 10 grasshoppers weighing 4,090 mg per 150 sweeps. Fire effects on the 4 most common species were variable and could be explained by the biology of the insects. Melanoplus bowditchi and M. flavidus were unaffected by fire treatment. Hesperotettix viridis is sensitive to damage to its host plants and was reduced about 88\% by fire in either season. Ageneotettix deorum abundance was 65\% lower on fall-burned plots. We hypothesize the reduction occurred because the species’ eggs are laid near the soil surface and exposed to the heat of passing fire. Fire prescriptions may be developed to target species-specific vulnerabilities and reduce pest grasshoppers while maintaining the food base for grasshopper predators.},

Grasshopper pest management tools include biological control, cultural control, and insecticides. This article describes a mechanistic, or processbased, modeling approach used to assess the development and abundance of the migratory grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes (Fabricius), based on a complex of environmental drivers. The purpose of the study was to develop and validate a model (using extensive field data) to quantify the effects of interannual weather variation on M. sanguinipes development and abundance in Saskatchewan, Canada. Overall, the accuracy of model predictions improved for later instars and adults such that predictions regarding adult populations were highly similar to field-collected data.The model provides greater understanding of how M. sanguinipes oviposition is related not only to adult densities, but also to the first appearance of adults and to weather conditions during the oviposition period. The model output can be used to provide accurate within-season updates of the status of grasshopper populations in western Canada to optimize pest management.},

Grasshopper exclosure and vegetation removal experiments were conducted to measure the effects of herbivory and within- and between-species competition on the performance of second year Gutierrezia microcephala plants. (2) In 1980, 93\% of plants in the natural vegetation were defoliated. The frequency of defoliation did not vary with plant size, distance from mature conspecifics, or with local vegetation composition. (3) The annual mortality of second year plants protected from grasshoppers was 8\% and did not vary when either conspecifics or perennial grasses or both types of competitors were removed from within 0.5 m of each plant. The death rate for plants exposed to grasshoppers was greatly affected by the presence of neighbouring plants; it ranged from 22\% when all neighbouring plants were removed to 47\% when the vegetation was left intact. Thus, the effect of competition on survivorship depended heavily on whether plants were also experiencing herbivore attack. (4) Protection from herbivory significantly increased plant growth in the following year as measured by changes in plant height and number of stems. Growth was also significantly increased by the removal of nearby perennial grasses. No significant interactions were observed between the effects of herbivore exclosure and competitor removal on plant growth. (5) Both protection from grasshoppers and removal of neighbouring plants significantly increased the size of annual wood increments in stems. (6) Comparison of these results for second year plants with studies of seedlings and of mature plants indicates that G. microcephala gradually becomes tolerant both to herbivore attack and between-species competition during its ontogeny.]},

Grasshopper density, survival and reproduction in the experimental populations responded in a density-dependent fashion to natural and experimental changes in food availability for all grasshopper developmental stages, both within and between all years. We observed that field populations of the grasshoppers at the site exhibited density, survival and reproductive responses similar to the experimental populations over the period of the study. Because we could not identify any differences between the field and microcosm environments or the grasshopper individuals in them, we contend that field populations were ultimately limited by food within and between years. Density-dependent food limitation occurred for all age categories over the entire summer, because food abundance declined relative to grasshopper food requirements over the summer. Food limitation occurred between years, because in years with the lowest food abundance, the populations produced more hatchlings for the next year than could be supported by the highest observed food abundance. Finally, the observed annual changes in food abundance were correlated with the annual variation in weather (rainfall and temperature), which indicated that the long established relationship between grasshopper densities and weather conditions does not imply population limitation by density-independent processes.},

We leveraged ten years of migratory grasshopper (Melanoplus sanguinipes) ﬁeld surveys to assess the response of nymph recruitment to projected climate conditions through the year 2040. Melanoplus sanguinipes is the foremost pest of grain, oilseed, pulse, and rangeland forage crops in the western United States. To assess nymph recruitment, we developed a multi-level, joint modeling framework that individually assessed nymph and adult life stages while concurrently incorporating density-dependence and accounting for observation bias connected to preferential sampling. Our results indicated that nymph recruitment rates will exhibit strong geographic variation under projected climate change, with population sizes at many locations being comparable to those historically observed, but other locations experiencing increased insect abundances. Our ﬁndings suggest that alterations to prevailing temperature and precipitation regimes as instigated by climate change will amplify recruitment, thereby enlarging population sizes and potentially intensifying agricultural pest impacts by 2040.},

Simulated 95\% confidence intervals indicate both C3 and C4 grasses increased forage quality and quantity under elevated [CO2]. C4 grasses were generally resistant to water limitation while forage quality and quantity of C3 grasses declined under simulated drought. Our results are consistent with literature on forage quantity responses to elevated [CO2] and drought, but forage quality responses contradict expectations.
